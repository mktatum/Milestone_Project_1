Sheldon has chosen you, his protege and champion, to battle Wil Wheaton in a game of chance. When the game begins, you will select an option from the 5 buttons listed, and Wil Wheaton will do the same. Whoever wins takes ultimate victory!

Should you need to review the rules of the game first, click the button below the character images for a full listing of options and what makes each victorious.

If you finish your game and lose, just keep trying! Nobel prizes weren't won in a day! If you win....BAZINGA! You've proven you're the best scientist out there! You can also choose to continue your trials by selecting the button at the bottom of the screen.

During the creation of this game I received guidance from both instructors Panos K and John Veith. That guidance is very much appreciated, and I believe it made this game a far better product.

A youtube video found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1_vHArDBRA was reviewed in the very beginning of the project and gave the foundation ideas for my starter code.
